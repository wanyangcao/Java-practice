		 			This package contains the object backed version of the Register action.  We have separated into
		 			a separate package for the sake of clarity.  Note, we are extending the chapterThreePublic package
		 			so that we can inherit all of the components.  We will reuse many of them.  We merely want to 
		 			take advantage of the modularization of Struts 2 to make the sample code more clear.  Note also 
		 			that we are still  using the same namespace as in the original chapter three version.
